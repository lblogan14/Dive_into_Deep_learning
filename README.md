# Learning Notes for the Book *Dive into Deep learning*

This repository contains learning notes for the book *Dive into Deep learning*.

To run the code in this repository, we need to install all the required packages in the d2l environment. Besides that, we also need to install the GPU version of PyTorch since the `torch` package in the d2l environment is the CPU version. We need to install the GPU version of PyTorch by ourselves.

In the Section of Reinforcement Learning, we may need to install the `gym` package via `conda install -c conda-forge gym=0.21.0` to avoid some errors.
